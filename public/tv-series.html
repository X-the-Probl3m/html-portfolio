 <h1>The Best Series According to Sergio</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 tv series that I've watched in 2024</h2>

 <hr/>

 <h3>1. Shogun</h3>
 <p>Through the show I found japanese culture really interesting. The visuals and acting was amazing. The story line is really captivating.</p>

 <h3>2. Breaking Bad</h3>
 <p>I liked how the show uses the setting, from the lighting to the props, to emphasise the storyline. 
    when the show starts there's a lot of colour and bright lights, which I think represents the love, joy and bond the main character Walter has for his family. We can see that Walter starts of as a good guy. As the show progresses, the lighting gets dimmer, the colour becomes darker. Which emphasises the person Walter has become, a dark, cold character. Which eventually tears his family apart. The story line is amazing and there's is a alot of interesting characters.

 <h3>3. How I Met Your Mother</h3>
<p>Well I didn't watch the series in 2024, it's still one of my favourite shows of all time. The story is about friendship, adventure, not giving up on finding love, and just enjoying your time with the people you love because oneday it might end. Barney is of course my favourite character, very funny individual. </p>
